### Real-Time Example-Based Face Stylization on Mobile Devices

This project deals with an implementation of Android mobile application allowing example-based style transfer from a given style exemplar to a human face captured by a built-in camera. The uniqueness of our application consists in the independence on any online computing resources. The entire process of stylization is computed offline by a mobile device and we seek for as fast as possible response of the application together with faithful reproduction of an artistic style. The mobile application uses an existing face detector for obtaining essential landmarks of a captured face. The project is based on a combination of two papers:
